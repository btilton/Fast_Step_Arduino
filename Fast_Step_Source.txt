Fast_Step - A program to output a 8-bit resolution step/ramp function on the Arduino's
            digital output pins 2 through 9.
Author - Brian Tilton
Purpose - Output an 8-bit step/ramp function for use as input to demonstrate a
          digital to analog converter (DAC)
          Also demonstrates the power and versitility of using assembler commands
          in conjuntion with Arduino's typical C-style language. Direct control
          of registers and ports allows this program to produce a step function
          with sharper steps, at a higher frequency, and in a smaller memory
          space than a similar program with no assembler commands.
Usage - Runs constantly when loaded onto the Arduino.
Note - This program was written specifically for the Arduino Duemilenova equipped
       with the Atmel ATmega328p microprocessor. Due to the nature of assembler commands
       this program is not guarenteed to run on other chipsets.

  PORTB = (byteOut >> 6); //logical bit shift to allign with ports.
  byteOut++;              //Then increment the output byte.
